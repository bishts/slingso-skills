description: The Slingso export command. Every answer Slingso recorded, as CSV or JSON. Use when the user says "slingso export" or wants Slingso's recorded AI Shopping Channel answers as a file.
license: MIT
compatibility: Needs the Slingso core skill (slingso) and the Slingso MCP (https://agents.slingso.com/mcp). Monitor and check in the assistant need a browser on the user's computer, Playwright first (the plugin brings @playwright/mcp; it needs Node.js), else the user's AI assistant's desktop app's built-in browser or other possibilities for agentic browsing (e.g - Claude in Chrome). Without one, query monitoring can't be automated with good quality, and answers are pasted, or Slingso's servers run the checks (the server add-on).

# Slingso: export

1. Follow the Slingso core skill first: start the session the same way it says, and keep its rules for every turn. It is the `slingso` skill: [../slingso/SKILL.md](../slingso/SKILL.md) beside this folder, or `skill://slingso/SKILL.md` when you read skills from the Slingso MCP.
2. Then do `export` per the core skill's reference for it: [../slingso/references/export.md](../slingso/references/export.md) (`skill://slingso/references/export.md` from the Slingso MCP).

If the core skill can't be found either way, tell the user the Slingso skill is missing and to install it from https://github.com/bishts/slingso-skills.
